Advanced Machine Learning project: Cyclic Coordinate Descent algorithm implementation for parameter estimation in regularized logistic regression with l1 (lasso) penalty.

Implementation is based on article: [Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v033i01).
